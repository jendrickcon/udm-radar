# Portal review findings template

Review candidate SHA/date/reviewer:
Implementer authorship and any reviewer-authored repairs:
Self-verification evidence received:
Cross-review scope (does not replace implementer's own tests):

## Required package context

- Product goal: coherent, understandable, role-appropriate analytics across Administrator, Faculty and Student; cite the [ten goals](../01_VISUAL_DIRECTION_AND_BOUNDARIES.md).
- User problem and visible outcome:
- Portal owner: Vincent = Administrator/Faculty; Member 2 = Student. Record actual name.
- Assigned branch: `feat/member1-admin-faculty-ui` or `feat/member2-student-portal`.
- Exact scope, literal files and non-goals:
- Visual contract: chart/details hierarchy, exact table below, real periods, scalar versus history, two groups/optional third/no fourth, visible coverage/n/limits:
- Calculation contract: approved source/API/helper, unit/population/eligibility/exclusions/denominator/weighting/comparability:
- Growth/change: exact start/end periods, point and supporting relative change, coverage/sample-size change; “Change unavailable” + reason when noncomparable:
- Complete/empty/provisional/unavailable/error states and table fallback:
- Shared-file integration owner per exact path, editing order and API impacts:
- Self-verification matrix and cross-portal regressions, with actual results or required BLOCKED evidence:
- Baseline/current main/HEAD full SHAs, clone path, branch and actual status:
- Immutable candidate when explicitly authorized; otherwise state no candidate and reason:
- Owner visible retest, unresolved findings and acceptance decision:
- Separate commit, push, PR, merge and deployment approvals; auto-merge off:

Neither member is universal UI/backend owner or tester-only. Each implements, tests, verifies and fixes its own portals. Cross-review supplements self-verification; original implementer retains fixes unless shared-contract ownership or explicit owner transfer applies. One clone and assigned long-lived branch per human; same-clone AI task branches start from own assigned HEAD; extra worktrees require owner exceptions.


## Verified findings

| ID / severity | Exact SHA/file/line or function | Expected approved behavior | Actual reproduction/evidence | Impact | Original implementer or shared custodian | Required minimal fix and regression | Publication blocker / disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Distinguish observed defects from untested risks. No redesign, silent formula change or weakened test to hide a failure. Proposed correction is not resolution; retest exact corrected candidate. Member 2 may cross-review Vincent's calculation/privacy/authorization assumptions; Vincent may cross-review Member 2's Student visual consistency/themes/accessibility. Original portal implementer fixes unless the defect belongs to another assigned shared contract or owner explicitly transfers the work.

## Review conclusion

Required evidence missing and gate blocked:
Owner visible retest:
Protected systems and current-main overlap:
Accepted limitations:
Exact next owner decision; no implied merge/push/deploy approval:

## Retained limits

Cohort numeric series, MTR-07 bounds, canonical MTR-21 and historical Faculty attribution remain BLOCKED without their approved evidence/contracts. Member 2 owns Student UI and its eleven-item cohort proposal; no pooled Admin mean, fabricated number or invented privacy threshold. Keep “Your recorded GWA” and “Comparable cohort average unavailable pending an approved cohort calculation and privacy contract.”

MTR-19 is a bounded receipt count; limited parent-case median is not MTR-21. MTR-20 remains approved arithmetic mean, displayed “Average time before the first notice” with human-readable duration and actual eligible n. No ranking/teaching-quality/effectiveness or official-standing inference. Use “Prototype performance on synthetic academic records”.

Current readiness preparation authorizes no production/DB/migration/Migration 011/model/dependency/auth edits, mobile tests, screenshots or publication. Frozen PR #63 files remain unchanged. Future runtime targets/tests require their own explicit scope and side-effect review. These amendments await local-commit approval; earlier `ee4ddf4b5e001328a1beeeea3471d58dd87c1614` does not include them.
